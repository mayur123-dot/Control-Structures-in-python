# Task 1
1) Input form the user
   n=int(input("Enter a number: "))
   Program will prompts the user to enter an integer.
   The input will read as string.
   Then the string will converted into intger using int() function

2) Understanding Even or Odd function
   If the number is divisible by 2 the number is Even %2==0
   If the number is not divisible by 2 then number is Odd %2!=0
   For finding the remainder the modulus operator (%) is used
      
3) Checking the condition If-Else
   Program uses an if-else statement to check the remainder of number when divided by 2
   If the remainder is 0 then nummber is Even
   If the remainder is non 0 then number is Odd
   Program-if n % 2==0:
    print(f"{n} is an even number")
    else:
    print(f"{n} is an odd number")

4) Output the result
   Progarm print the result based on the condition
